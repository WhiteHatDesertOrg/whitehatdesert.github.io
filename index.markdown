**White Hat Desert 2023** is a community driven **FREE** cybersecurity event. WHD is returning yet again to fill your day with a range of cyber security talks, 4x4 dune bashing, local meals and interesting conversations related to cyber security.

The goal of this event is to expand the spectrum of conversation beyond the traditional confines of conference rooms. It creates opportunities for individuals to both present and participate in an intimate atmosphere that encourages collaboration for cyber security specialists located in Qatar. 

It is an intense event with challenges, discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. It is where conversations for the next-big-thing are happening.
